## Discription:
This is a react web application that I have created in order to simulate the Monty Hall problem.

### What is the Monty Hall problem?
According to Wikipedia: The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975. It became famous as a question from reader Craig F. Whitaker's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's 'Ask Marilyn' column in Parade magazine in 1990.

#### The problem:
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, 'Do you want to pick door No. 2?' Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? - (From Parade magazine's Ask Marilyn column) -Source: staticshowto.com


#### So what do you do, switch doors or stick with your first pick?
Believe it or not, it's actually to your benefit to switch. If you switch, you have roughly a 2/3 chance of winning the car. If you stick to your original choice you have roughly a 1/3 chance of winning the car. The answer sounds unlikely. After door 3 is opened, you would think that you then have two doors to choose from â€¦both with the same odds. However, you are actually much more likely to win if you switch. Many statisticians are still dumbfounded by this and it has been proven time and time again!

## Installation:
In order to use this application you have to ensure that Node.js runtime is installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed aleady you can install it form [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once Node.js runtime is installed ,you can download all the following files to a directory of your choice. Once all the files have been dowloaded you can open the directory within an IDE of your choice. Open a new terminal within your IDE and navigate to the directory you have downloaded the files to. Once in the directory, run `npm install` in order to download and install necessary files like node_modules. The download may take some time. After everything has been downloaded you can move on to the next step below.

## Usage: 
After everything has been downloaded you can now run the `npm start` command on your computer. A new window should open up by itself within your browser if not, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You should now be able to play the game! Any changes made to files should automatically update your view within the browser after a save.

You will be greeted with a single web page that explains the game to you. There are 3 doors that you can click on. Once a door is clicked a losing door will open and then you can decide to click the door that you have originally chosen or switch to another door. A message will be displayed informing you that you have either won or lost.
